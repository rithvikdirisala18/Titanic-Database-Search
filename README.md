# Titanic Database Search
A C++ program that processes Titanic passenger data from a user-uploaded CSV file, allowing dynamic queries to retrieve detailed passenger information based on various attributes.

ðŸ›  Features & Implementation
- Efficient CSV Parsing: Reads and processes large datasets using file I/O and string tokenization to extract relevant fields.
- Data Storage & Retrieval: Utilized hash maps and vectors to store passenger details, enabling fast lookups and efficient query execution.
- Flexible Query System: Users can search passengers by:

  ðŸ”¹ Fare

  ðŸ”¹ Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, unknown)

  ðŸ”¹ Embarkation Port (Cherbourg, Queenstown, South Hampton, unknown)

This project highlights file handling, structured data processing, and search optimizations in C++, making it a practical tool for historical analysis or dataset exploration.

ðŸ”¹ Try it out, upload a dataset, and explore the stories of Titanic passengers!
